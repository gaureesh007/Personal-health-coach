Project Name

MedReduce AI – Cost-Efficient Health Monitoring Agent

Objective

Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:

Stores lifelong medical history

Compresses and summarizes past data

Integrates real-time wellness metrics

Generates personalized health recommendations

Minimizes LLM token usage and compute cost

Core Problem

Healthcare AI systems fail because:

Medical history grows too large

Context window cost explodes

Repeated tokens increase API billing

Redundant retrieval wastes compute

We solve this using:

Intelligent summarization

Medical memory compression

Selective retrieval

Lightweight LLM orchestration
